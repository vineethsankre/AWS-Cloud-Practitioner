# Cloud Concepts

#### Cloud Computing

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process date rather than a local server or a personal computere.

| You take all the risk        | You are responsible for your configuringcloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest |

AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure are examples of cloud providers

- **Saas(Software as a Service):** A completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
  
  Examples are Gmail, office 365, Salesforce.

- **Paas(Platform as a Service):** Removes the need for your origanization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  
  Examples are  Google app engine, force.com etc.

- **Iaas(Infrastructure as a Service):** The basic building blocks for cloud IT, provide access yo networking features, computers and data storage.
  
  Examples are AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, vmware etc.

#### Deployment models for cloud computing

When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements. The three cloud computing deployment models are **cloud-based**, **on-premises**, and **hybrid**

#### **1. Cloud-based deployment:**

•Run all parts of the application in the cloud.

•Migrate existing applications to the cloud.

•Design and build new applications in the cloud.

For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud.

#### **2. On-premises deployment:**

•Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.

•Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization
technologies.

For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center. Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization.

#### **3. Hybrid Deployment:**

•Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.

•Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

For example, suppose that a company wants to use cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics. However, the company has several legacy applications that are more suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud. With a hybrid deployment, the company would be able to keep the legacy applications on premises while benefiting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud.

#### **Six Advantages and Benefits of Cloud computing**

1. **Trade capital expense for variable expense:**

No upfront cost: Instead of paying for data centers and servers

Pay on Demand: Pay only when you consume computing resources

2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale:**

Usage of hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud. You are sharing the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings

3. **Stop guessing capacity:**

Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers as in case of premises, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.

4. **Increase speed and agility**

Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT to implement the solution on-premise

5. **Stop spending monet on running and maintaining data centers:**

Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of rackinf, stacking, and powering servers

6. **Go global in minutes:**

Deploy your app in multiple regions areund the world with a few clicks. Provide lower latency and a better experience for you customers at minimal cost
